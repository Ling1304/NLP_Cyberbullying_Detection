# Cyberbully Tweet Classification
In this project, I preprocessed the tweets and applied oversampling to balance the classes. I then trained an SVM model to identify instances of cyberbullying in tweets, with the model also capable of classifying the specific type of cyberbullying, such as ethnicity, religion, and others.
