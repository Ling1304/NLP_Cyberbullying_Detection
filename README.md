# Cyberbullying Detection and Classification in Tweets Using Suppor Vector Machine (SVM) 
This small project focuses on identifying and classifying instances of cyberbullying in tweets. Cyberbullying on social media platforms is a pervasive issue, with harmful impacts on individuals and communities. To address this, the project involves the following key steps:

## Data Preprocessing:
Cleaning and preprocessing raw tweets to remove noise such as hashtags, mentions, and unnecessary symbols.
Tokenization, stop-word removal, and text normalization to prepare data for analysis.

## Class Balancing with Oversampling:
Addressing the challenge of imbalanced datasets by applying oversampling techniques to ensure that all classes, including minority ones, are well-represented during model training.

## Model Training with Support Vector Machine (SVM):
Leveraging SVM, a robust and efficient machine learning algorithm, to build a model capable of detecting cyberbullying.
The model not only identifies whether a tweet is an instance of cyberbullying but also classifies the specific category of bullying, such as ethnicity-based, religion-based, gender-based, or others.

## Evaluation and Insights:
Evaluating the model's performance using accuracy.
Gaining actionable insights into the prevalence and types of cyberbullying in the dataset.
This project uses machine learning to promote safer online interactions. By detecting and categorizing cyberbullying, it can aid in developing automated moderation tools and raising awareness about the nature of abusive content on social media platforms.
